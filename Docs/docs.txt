Note: Today is the 20th of November and I began this project around the 10th of November.
Technology: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, MySQLite3

Issues:
1. link broken can't switch between the different HTML files available.
2. backend with Python and MySQL can't download the required pip file for the connection to bridge MySQL with the Python file called beans.py
3. The client side with the layout of the form on the home page and the file for the bean calculator isn't presentable. Need to fix the style of the layout of the pages.
Database issues:
1. When downloaded a pip python connection I recieve an error message. Cant use the pip method.
2. CANCEL / Going with PHP, MySQL & Apache for the backend...
3. Backend Service: https://app.xano.com/login
3a. Backend Service: https://supabase.com (Leaning in this direction)
4. This tool is similar to Bootstrap: https://boxicons.com/usage called Boxicons

Table To Be Used For My Coffee Measurements (StarBucks) Caffe Americano

<table>(OUTPUT FIELD)
    id = "bean_math_cupSize"; (size)
    id = "espresso_result"; (espresso)
    id = "total_mg"; (total mgs)
</table>
<form>(INPUT FIELD)
    id = "size"; (size)
    id = "espresso"; (espresso)
    id = "daily"; (total)
</form>


Espresso: 1-shot = 75mgs
8.0z = Short (75mg Standard(1-shot, Espresso))
